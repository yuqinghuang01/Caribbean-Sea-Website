        The steep cliff you saw in the picture is situated in one of the most beautiful
        beaches in the world -- Grote (Big) Knip of Cura&ccedilao. People from all over
        the world come to this place to taste the thrilling feeling of diving from the
        cliff, to walk on the soft white sand, and to snorkel in the clear sea water.
        Just as the photo shows, the royal blue sea is blended into the sky, the rock
        mountains surround the sea ... Simply standing there gives you a feeling of
        tranquility and amazement.

        As a tropical region, Cura&ccedilao is also known for its colorful houses. Walking
        on the street, with the colors of the houses dazzling under the sun, you come to feel
        the wild and passionate nature of the Cura&ccedilao people. It is definitely an
        enjoyable experience to your eyes.

        Aruba is one of the most famous places for snorkeling. I was fortunate to
        participate in an excursion, which took us to some place far away from the seashore,
        where lots of clusters of colorful fishes can be seen. The feeling when you see fishes
        coming towards you rapidly is far beyond words, as if you discovered a whole new world
        -- the world under the water. To be honest, I am not very good at swimming, which made
        this activity a bit challenging to me. However, the fascination drove away my fear.
        And this is a truly relaxing activity since it allows you to enjoy your own "private"
        time with the nature.

        After seeing so many beaches, I began to change my previous notion that all beaches more
        or less look the same. As I come to appreciate the nature more and pay more attention to
        the beauty lying in details, every beach seems unique to me. The different colors of the
        sea, the different feelings of the sand, the different living species under water ... And
        when you take the time to discover and appreciate all these little things around us, your
        mind will be broadened, and your heart will become so pure.

        For me, this Caribbean cruise trip can be condensed into two words.
    </font>
</p>

<p>
    <font size="5" color="white">
        The first one is "FAMILY". Spending the whole cruise trip with my family has added more
        weight and meaning to it. Every now and then, when I think of this trip, one comment
        in a conversation will still make me laugh, and one moment will still make me touched.
        This trip is significant because it is shared with the people I truly care about.
    </font>
</p>

<p>
    <font size="5" color="white">
        The second word is "NATURE". It may sound obvious, but by putting yourself out in the
        nature, you can refresh your mind and body in a way that you cannot easily imagine. The nature
        arouses your passion for more discovery and give you the opportunity to embrace the vastness
        of our planet.
